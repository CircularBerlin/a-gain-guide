Advicetext: <h3>Good advice</h3><p>Before donating clothing that is dirty or mouldy, or has moths, please take it to a laundry centre, or wash them at home. This is because the majority of second-hand shops or charities do not have the capacity to wash clothes before selling them/ handing them out. And let's be honest, who wants to touch dirty or mouldy clothes from unknown donors, or inherit clothes moths into their wardrobes?</p><p>We can't offer you a solution for dirty clothes or clothes with moths, but we kindly advise you to check on our map for sustainable laundry centres in town.</p>
