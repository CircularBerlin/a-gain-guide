Depending on the leather type and how it is processed, the surface can feel soft (like suede) or rough. It can be dyed in any color but is often used in its original, natural colour. There are major differences in the origin and processing of leather, which may involve corresponding negative environmental impacts or be more animal-friendly and sustainably produced.</p>'

Textiles are then formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, tatting, felting, bonding, or braiding these yarns together. As long as fibers are mixed and/or not ideally reused or disposed of, recycling processes are unfortunately (still) hardly applicable in a senseful way.</p>'
